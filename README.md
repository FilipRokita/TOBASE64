# TOBASE64

ToBase64 is a simple Python script that allows you to convert a file to Base64 encoding. The script uses the popular `base64` library to encode the contents of a file as Base64 data.

## How to Use

To use ToBase64, run the script in your Python environment and provide the file path as a command-line argument. For example, if you want to encode a file called "example.txt", run the script with the following command:

```
python ToBase64.pyw /path/to/example.txt
```

This will create a new file in the same directory as the original file with the extension ".b64", containing the Base64-encoded data.

## Dependencies

This script requires the `base64` library to be installed in your Python environment.
